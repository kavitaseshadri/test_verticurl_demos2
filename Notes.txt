ReactJS-useState()-we can't do any state mangement for components
useContext()-its a context that can contain data and functions and can be made available to multiple components simultaneously without props-drilling
we still have to see, lifting up the state 


useEffect()
useReducer()-is a substitute for useState, when there are multiple inter-linked states to deal with.

ReactJS Project using Yarn not NextJS 


23/July/2024-Tuesday
....................

Getting started with NextJS
yarn create next-app

What is your project named? › nextjs-firstapp
? Would you like to use TypeScript? › No / Yes (No)
? Would you like to use ESLint? › No / Yes (Yes)
? Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? › No / Yes (No)
? Would you like to use `src/` directory? › No / Yes (Yes)
? Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) › No / Yes (Yes)
? Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? › No / Yes (No)

once the creation is successful, switch to the project folder and run-
yarn dev 

Vercel 
NextJS 

Directory Structure:
public 
src/app 
layout.js
page.js
globals.css
page.module.css

the home screen is getting rendered from page.js

NextJS allows you to setup multiple pages.
SSR-Server Side Rendering 
ReactJS-Client Side Rendering-There are no pre-compiled components in ReactJS
you can't build SEO friendly pages using ReactJS!!

Caching System for NextJS 
server side components 
client side components

Do not change the name of page.js
also don't change the name of layout.js

How to create a multi page website?
go to app, and create one folder for each page of your website,
then add a page.js into that folder

params.slug
{params}

[slug] folder under a particular category

src/components
src/app

Assignment: Create a New NEXTJS app-
to combine Animal, Profile, Book App into 1 project

we need one page.js for Animal
we need one page.js for Profile
we need one page.js for Book

'use client' this will be the first line in all the components that try to do event handling or use any ReactJS Hooks

React-Router-DOM 

NEXTJS 
client components-React Hooks ()
server components-that want to interact with DB data

html tags will detect their children or nested components\
But our components by default do not detect their children or nested tags.


Hooks were designed only for Functional Components
They are not meant to be used by Class components-lifecycle

In a react application, there can be multiple contexts

Custom Hook-helps you to make your logic re-usable across components 
Context is applied to Tree of Components 
whoever needs the functionality from a Custom Hook can use it
Context goes beyond just  functions, it can also contain data 

{ children }

yarn create next-app


useContext-BookApp
-Centrallization, 
-We can control who can access it or see it or use it
useEffect Hook
JSON Server-BookApp-sharing code 
Custom Hook
useReducer 
useRef
usePortal
Navigation-React-Router-DOM

<BookList>
<BookCreate>
<BookShow>
<BookEdit>

<BookApp>-array and CRUD operation functions, props drilling 
  <BookList>-><BookShow>,<BookEdit>
  <BookCreate>


18/July/2024-Thursday
.....................

props drilling-Parent tries to pass its' data to the child
lifting up the state-the parent tries to access a property that is defined in the Child

BookApp1-CRUD done using arrays 
BookApp-useContext()
BookApp-CRUD-JSONServer as our backend-useEffect()

Create a Book
Edit a Book
Delete a Book
Fetch all Books 

bookapp-context, expense-app: npm install, npm start

17/July/2024-Wednesday
......................

When you download my ReactJS or NextJS project, make sure to run npm install
only then, node_modules will be created


ProfileApp
AnimalApp
ArrayApp
BookApp-Standalone, JSONServer, Proper Backend 
ExpenseApp

Custom Component-how to pass values to it to customize it
Parent-Child props passing 
conditional rendering 

How will ProfileApp which is the parent, 
pass data to ProfileCard which in this context is the child,
so that it's UI or behaviour can be customized

You can't write conditions or loop in JSX
Conditional Operator is the only thing that is allowed in JSX
offer && 

useContext()-
useEffect()-
useReducer()-

data resides in ProfileApp8>ProfileList->ProfileCard8

ReactJS
more examples-

You cannot use any of the traditional DOM logic 
hacks 
Component Architecture
Parent/Child relationship 
Nesting between tags-
props drilling
lifting up the State
Hooks-
useState()
State Management-is done in a twisted way using useState()
Because I don't have access to the html elements directly,

useState-it's a hook, a hook is basically a JavaScript Function

State management for components is one of them.

destructuring of arrays?

const fruits=['mango','banana','apple','watermelon','orange'];
const [fruit1,,,fruit4,]=fruits;

let msg="hello";

useState();
it actually returning an array of two elements
first item it returns is a variable (state management variable)
second item it returns is a function to edit that variable
we can assign initial value to useState()


reactjs uses it's own Virtual DOM tree that it links to the original undelying DOM tree.

Problem Statement-

Create a UI with 2 inputs fields to accept 2 numbers 
also a drop down with 4 options-addition, subtraction,multiplication,division
a button with caption Submit 
now depending on what option has been choosen show the calculation of the result in a new text field

Project Structure 

We don't do any DOM manipulation 

public/index.html keep it, delete some of the rubbish in it
src>App.css, App.js,index.css clear it out
index.js keep it as is

rafce-generates boiler plate code for react functional components
ES7 React snippets extension(ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets )

Functional components-all the current projects use this
Class components-when reactjs was first introduced we only had class components
SPA-Single Page Application 

typically we don't change anything in index.html
div with id root, this is where our component tree will be inserted!
so don't delete this

index.js-we will add/change only one thing
Similary, App.js, we will typically change only one thing

We are going to be creating tons of Custom Functional components
The client (browser) receives only one reponse in the form of a single html file that is sent only once by the application, unless I referesh my browser
index.html

App.js 
App.css 

index.js
index.css 

One component per file 
component.js
component.css 

react takes care of DOM manipulation, you're are not allowed  to do DOM manipulation
we will never ever use the document object

Hooks-a hook is nothing but a function given to us by React for a specific purpose 
In the  component file, what we are writing is not html,
it is a pseudo html called JSX created by the ReactJS Template
JavaScript and XML 

How to mix programming syntaxes with HTML 
EJS <%= %>

Library, it is not a framework- so it doesn't impose any strict folder convention

In react, every file is its own module
so, if you want a component to be visible outside the file, export it, and the other that wants to use the component should import it!

What forms/HTML pages do we need for our Student Scenario?
1) display all student records-Edit/Update, Delete 
2) add Student Form/html page will be empty form 
3) update Student-will be a Form/html page that would be pre-populated
4) login
5) logout

MVC

Model
View
Controller-
Will check send a view page/or some sort of form to accept  data
then it will read the form
then it will call the appropriate Model for backend operation
then it will call another view component to compose a response page
send this response page back to the user

run npm init in day21 folder 

npm install express body-parser serve-static cookie-parser cookie-session mongodb mongoose --save

Mongoose-

starts with a Schema definition
Then we create a Model from the Schema
Then we use the Model to create objects that need to be perisited
we don't need to define any methods for basic CRUD and search operation

MongoDB will allow you to store miscellaneus objects in your collection
Mongoose will only allow homogenous object 

Using MongoDB driver will allow you to store any and all kinds of objects in the same collection

ORM-Object Relational mapping
ODM-Object Document mapping 

MongoDB shell
Using MongoDB Driver in our node application to connect to MongoDB
Using Mongoose ODM to connect our node application to MongoDB-they made API flatter, Schema


MongoDB-Document Database is the complete opposite of RDBMS 
Schema-is the format in which I want to store my data 
name of my table,
how many columns,
data types 

JavaScript Object-it lets us think about things in terms of objects 
JavaScript<->json

Text File-then everything will be stored as text, data types will be lost and will require conversion, text files can read directly by human
Binary File-then I can preserve the data type, you can't read it directly, it can only be read programatically
text file is human readable
binary file is machine readable 

There is no table as such 
Table=Collection (of objects)-hetrogenous collection of objects 
Row=Document (is actually just one single object)
There will be a single DB Instance and all our Tables will belong there 

Here, we can create as many DBs we want 
It's a light weight document based db 
where everything is stored in a text file-BSON file which JSON+Binary Data Storage

JavaScript Object can easily be stored in a MongoDB database without much effort.
This  can be done both on the shell and programatically

I can represent relations from the real world in a more meaning ful way using OOP

const Person= {
  let name='Cat',
  let age=25,
  const officeAddress= {

  },
   const homeAddress= {

  }
  const salary={
    let hra='',
    let basic='',
    let specialBonus='',

routes splitting:

We can make use of a anothe object present in the express framework-router 


A minimum of two http methods need to be supported per url-
/home GET, POST 

We want to split our application into separate layers and put each layer in a different file/folder combination
we don't want to write our entire application logic in single file like app.js or server.js
controller 
(it will contain the actual business logic or it will call the Business Layer, 
the Business Layer in turn can call the Persistence Layer), 

routes(mapping of url to the respective controller)
model/persistence layer: will contain code to access the database-document/rdbms 

so if my application logic does not reside in the same file, then the other files will have to be accessed through the module system

view: will contain all the code to generate dynamic html either using HTML String Literal Template or other Template Engines like EJS, Handlerbars or PUG
mvc_split1


mvc_split2
in this project we will create a controller folder, and copy admin.js and customer.js from the previous project into this folder
then we create another new folder called routes-with two new files admin.js and customer.js, these files will only contain route optmization

RESTFUL API 

MVC or RESTful where the frontend would be some kind SPA application

/ POST we will process the login form 
/register GET then we will server register.html
/register POST we will process the register form

your starting point in the node application can be a file that is conventionally called

public>index.html src node_modules 

we will keep our app.js/server.js/index.js outside public folder 
why? becuase anything you put in public folder is automically accesible by end user
we will not keep any script files in public folder
typically we only keep index.html in that file, this file is the home page 
index.html - Home Page 






starting e-commerce application 


Node will scan for node_modules folder

node_modules contains all the dependencies physically installed

parent>child>inner 

parent>child>inner>a.js 

assume that a.js is physically present in inner folder 
let connect=require('connect');
node a.js 

before that, it will look for a folder called node_modules in inner folder
first the system will look for connect installation in inner's node_modules folder 

it will look for a folder called node_modules in the current folder
if no such folder is found, then it will go check the parent folder-child (folder)
if no such folder is found in child (folder), then it will go check child's parent folder
which in this case happens to be parent (folder)
This scanning will continue, until a node_modules folder 
with the necessary package installation in found in the hierarchy

limitations of http module

var server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{

})

if I'm using http to build my web-application, I will have to determine and manage every last detail associated with the Request
I will have to determine very http method&url combination and then take an action accordingly
request object contains all the information received from the browser(client)
url
http method
form parameters
headers-metdata about the browser itself!

GET-when you type any url in the address bar of the browser, also any hyperlink, and any form submitted using method as GET-
all these requests will be sent as a GET request

POST-form method="POST"

installing external modules 

npm install connect --save

a folder called as node_modules is created in the pwd
and this dependency is installed in that folder, also listed in package.jsons

for any node project-
first create a directory
switch to that directory
then run npm init (go with defaults, unless you want to change something)
you can go with the default by pressing enter
then confirm, this process creates a package.json
after that start your installation-
npm install connect --save
after the package.json is created, we can do the installtion, as a result
 two things will happen-
 node_modules folder will be created
 the dependency will be listed in package.json


npm install express --save

The people who created express are connect are the same
Express has been built on top of connect

For package scanning, there is a very useful system followed by node


connect

when you install them using npm command,
this dependency will be saved in package.json

how to create a new project

npm init 

NodeJS follows the CommonJS module specification. 
Kevin Dongaoor created CommonJS in 2009

ES Module System-ReactJS, NextJS

Package and Deploy JS applications


Module System-CommonJS
events, files, streams, buffer, http 

Packages/modules-NodeJS Ecosystem
path, fs, event, http

web server from scratch using http module 
express-framework that has been built on top of http 

Modules/Module System
......................

To make code more manageable and re-usable
Each file is it's own module-a.js,b.js,c.js 
and, by default, you don't have access to anything declared in other modules
unless the other module decides to export it

export/import
to export something from a module we will make use of
module.exports 

To import a module, use the globally available 
require function

if something has to be made accessible outside a file/module, you will have to export it
if you want to use something from another file, then you've to import it

when I create a module, that is basically an .js file in node,
I can export one or multiple things from the file.

and, then, when I'm importing something from the module, I can't import it using any name
names do not matter in nodejs!

There are three kinds of modules in Node.js: 
core modules-path, event,stream, http, fs 
file modules-what we are doing right now
and 
external node_modules-we will be installing these using npm commmand


all of which use the require function.

in all the examples so far, one module is being imported by several different modules
every time a module is imported, is the system going to create a new copy that variable?
or will it make all modules share the  same copy? 
thereby preventing the pollution of global namespace?

How to Create a Node Project-

npm init
this command will create a file called as package.json
which contains all the metadata for a node.js project
all dependencies
starting script

node_modules 
this folder will show up or get created, only once we install 3rd party modules-express, session
package.json is a simple json file

fix yesterday's moveX bug

when JS is being imported from an external .js file, the location of the import is very important
 <script src="app.js"></script>

 We will discuss how to import external js files in an html page,
 and will be the visiblity of these files etc.

NodeJS-module system, 
files and events-async 
XHR XML Http Request-primitive (underlying fundamental browser object that is doing all the work for you in the background when you use fetch or axios)

fetch API-Old Internet Explorer
axios API-it's a better looking cleaner version of fetch

any external RESTAPI you will be using fetch and axios
fetch and axios also return Promises 
then(),catch()
async and await

jsonplaceholder api-

users
posts
comments

NodeJS-DB, EJS Template, RESTFUL API, mongodb,mongoose,postgres, express+http
HTTP Methods: GET,POST,DELETE, PUT, OPTIONS etc
HTTP Request-Response cycle: takes place between the browser and the web-app server

I don't need to import anything to use fetch API- becuase it is the browser's native API

async is a substitute for not using new Promise and resolve and reject in your api implementation
await is a substitute for not using then() and catch() in your api calling






async
await

code organization in client side javascript-
1) HTML, <script></script>
you can include the script tag as many times as you want in the html page
2) HTML, app.js (app.txt)

Promises-
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an Aysnchronous task
a long running operation-whether it will succeed or whether it will fail
a long running-DB, File, Network 

Promise-a pattern for writing asynchronous code
setTimeout()-all aysnc, it will be removed from the main flow of the application
in the meantime, you call stack will execute

when you create a promise, it doesn't contain anything concrete, it doesn't have any results for you
that is why, you have a to wait.
if you try to obtain anything from a promise, until it has resolved into something successful or into a  failure

Until it has resolved or rejected, in the meantime what you get is a promise.

we need to the promise object two things-
two functions-

a function/callback that will be called if the promise is resolved
a function/callback that will be called if the promise is rejected

what/how should the promise notify you if it is successful or if it fails

Promise object gives us two functions
then()
catch()

we are passing the success callback to then() function
we passing the failure callback to the catch() function


willgetyouadog is a reference that is pointing to a Promise object!

we have seen, how to pass a success and failure callback to our promise
now, let's how the promise will pass us back some data!!


async and await keywords-these are called as syntactical sugar for the Promise

Aysnchronous JavaScript:
Callstack 
JS is Single Threaded
difference between synchronous and asynchronous

Animations,File, Network, DB Operations->success, failure, exception-delay
waiting, or hanging or not allowing it to do anything else,
 simply because we are waiting for some response from the DB server


How Aysnc Callback Actually Works

setTimout()
setInterval()


Callback Nesting and Callback Hell

I'm  calling a function-
that function has to do some job/task
it has to fetch something from somewhere-file,network, DB
do some Animation

now, this caller in JS will always ask for 2 callback
success callback
failure callback

this JS function will let us know that it has succeeded by calling our success callback
this JS function will let us know that it has failed by calling our failure callback




Callback nesting or Promises
OOP

Promisises, Async,Await



Http, DB, RESTAPI, 
DOM, Events, BOM-we will be coming to this

...................

Today-
map, reduce, filter
functional constructors-OOP representation
class, extends, static, public, protected etc-syntactical sugar 
Prototype based inheritance
alert(),prompt()-CUI
Object Literal
Student
Box-length, width, height, color, material accept(),display(), volume()
ObjectLiteral
function constructor
ask the end user how many objects he wants to create

this, closure 

GUI-DOM, async-ReactJS

......................

Today-
ES6 features required for ReactJS-
array-spread, rest , destructuring 


later we will be discussing about-data types, operators, equality check
using ==, ===

let callback=function(){
  $("p").click(function(){
    $(this).hide();
  });
}

$(document).ready(callback);

Yesterday-
function syntax
higher order function, functions are first class citizens in JS
IEF-Immediately Executing functions
Anonymous Functions
started Callbacks
nested functions
closures
started object literal
started array declaration
started setTimeout()

Today-
adding methods to Object literal
-this is going to make it's first appearance
arrow functions-ES6 feature
Array functions-map,reduce,filter, push, pop, unshift
ES6 features required for ReactJS-
spread, rest , destructuring 

11/June/2024-Tuesday
...................

Yesterday-
var, let, const
var-supported redeclaration
let,const-do not support re-declaration
started with scope a little bit
if,else,loops do not create a new scope for variable

started defining functions
arrow function
callbacks-WHAT, WHY? 
WHAT-what is possible syntactically
WHY?-why do we need this?
NodeJS-callback
ReactJS Library-class, v16.x functional 

nested functions
closure
ES6 features-ReactJS
OOP functional style
class, extends, static, public, private
OOP functions

IEF-Immediately Executing function
You can execute a function immediately after you define it.
We simple wrapt the function in parantheses()


callback-
In JS functions are called as first class citizens
In JS you can pass a function 
-as an argument to another function.
OOP Java-objects are the first class citizens

map, reduce, filter-
setTimout(),setInternal()
http(), calling RESTAPI

Object literal
we try to avoid traditional classes and object instantiation where not required.

Object Literal is not a substitute for the  class construct!
class-bluprint
Object Literal is an object itself!

Prototype

Presentation-
Structure-html
Styling-css
Action/Interaction-JavaScript
JavaScript-ES6

Top 10 things to get started with

var,let,const,scope
a little about data types and operators
array syntax
object literal
function syntax
special function syntax-
functions are first class citizens in JavaScript
higher order functions
callbacks, callback nesting

nested functions
closure
function constructors
arrow functions
OOPs Constructs in JavaScript

client-javascript
server -javascript

Logistics-

1) html page,inline javascript <script></script>
2) html page,external javascript file .js, imported into html
3) nodejs-shell, .js you may also directly write your code into the
node shell


install nodejs
browser-console
using nodejs-nodejs, reactjs,nextjs
html page, 




Chrome-v8 Engine run your Javascript


html,css-browser
javascript-v8 engine

v8
components-

nodejs-execution environment for javascript to run in the backend



1) JavaScript-variables are declared without any type
2) you can assign a value of any data type to java script variable

CUI-
GUI-BOM, DOM
Browser Object Model-document, window
Document Object Model-













ECMA Script

w3c-

ES-6-2015-ReactJS
